# Salesforce-Stripe Payment Processing Integration
## Integration Developer Capstone Project

Welcome to your capstone project! You'll be building a production-ready payment processing solution that integrates Salesforce with Stripe to manage customer subscriptions and payments.

## Project Overview

Your organization needs a payment processing solution that connects Salesforce with Stripe to handle customer subscriptions and payments. The finance team, sales team, and customer service representatives need to manage the complete customer payment lifecycle within Salesforce while leveraging Stripe's secure payment infrastructure.

**Project Goal**: Build an integration that allows the business to manage customers, subscriptions, and payments seamlessly between Salesforce and Stripe.

## What You'll Build

### Business User Stories

**Sales Representatives need to:**
- Create customer records in Salesforce that automatically sync to Stripe
- Set up new subscriptions for customers with different pricing plans
- Generate secure payment links that customers can use to complete their subscription signup
- Track subscription status and billing periods

**Customer Service Representatives need to:**
- See when customer data changes in Stripe and have it update in Salesforce automatically
- Access complete customer payment information when helping with support requests

**Finance Team Members need to:**
- Monitor subscription renewals and cancellations
- Track successful and failed payments
- Receive notifications when subscriptions change status
- Maintain records of all payment transactions

**Customers need to:**
- Receive secure payment links to complete subscription signup
- Use preferred payment methods through a trusted payment interface
- Have confidence that payment information is handled securely

### Core Business Processes

**New Customer Onboarding**:
1. Sales rep creates a Contact in Salesforce with customer details
2. Customer information is automatically sent to Stripe to create a customer account
3. Sales rep can set up a subscription for the customer
4. Customer receives a secure payment link to complete signup
5. Once payment is complete, subscription becomes active in both systems

**Ongoing Customer Management**:
1. Any customer changes in Stripe automatically update the Salesforce record
2. Subscription status changes (renewals, cancellations, failures) are reflected in Salesforce
3. Payment successes and failures are tracked and visible to the finance team
4. Customer service has access to complete payment and subscription history

## Project Requirements

### Duration & Team Structure
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Team Size**: 3 members maximum
- **Individual Orgs**: Each team member works in separate orgs with shared GitHub repository
- **Collaboration**: Required through Slack, virtual meetings, and code reviews

### Success Criteria
1. **Functional Integration**: Customers, subscriptions, and payments flow seamlessly between systems
2. **Data Accuracy**: Information is consistent and up-to-date in both Salesforce and Stripe
3. **Security**: Payment processing meets industry security standards
4. **Reliability**: System handles errors gracefully and retries failed operations
5. **Usability**: Business users can manage the entire customer payment lifecycle from Salesforce

### Security Requirements
- All payment data must be handled through Stripe's secure infrastructure
- No credit card information should be stored or processed directly in Salesforce
- API communications must be authenticated and secure
- Webhook data must be verified to ensure it comes from Stripe

## Getting Started

### 1. Research Phase
- Review the complete business requirements provided by your instructor
- Investigate Stripe's API capabilities and Salesforce integration options
- Understand the data flow between systems

### 2. Design Phase
- Plan your data model to support the business processes
- Design your integration architecture
- Determine security and authentication approaches

### 3. Build Phase
- Implement customer synchronization (Salesforce â†’ Stripe)
- Build subscription management with secure checkout
- Create webhook processing for real-time updates
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Test & Deploy
- Verify all business requirements are met
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Create user documentation
- Prepare final demonstration

## Key Questions to Consider

- How will you structure data in Salesforce to support the business processes?
- What Stripe APIs will you need to accomplish these business goals?
- How will you ensure data stays synchronized between the systems?
- What happens when something goes wrong - how will you handle errors?
- How will you secure the integration and protect customer data?
- What will the user experience look like for different types of users?

## Additional Resources

Your instructor will provide detailed project requirements and weekly planning guidance through external documentation.

## Remember

The goal is to solve business problems through technology. Focus on what the business needs to accomplish, then determine the best technical approach to deliver those outcomes. This project should demonstrate your ability to build production-ready integrations that real businesses could deploy and use.

Good luck with your capstone project!
